# Retro looking trivia

## [ENG - ESP]

### _using vanilla Javascript, HTML, CSS and the OpenTrivia API._

## [ENG]

This little project was born as a way to continue practising my skills on an more dynamic website.

## How to play

1. Click the "Start" button.
2. Select a difficulty and click "Play" (If no difficulty is selected, it will default to easy).
3. Answer the questions with the option you deem correct and click "Next"
4. View the amount of answer you got right. To replay just click the "Restart" button and repeat from step 2.

## Why the old monitor aspect

After multiple ideas this design not only looked good, but also had some styling challenges that I never used.
Researching and studying about the Cathode ray tubes and filters was really fun.

## Completed Goals

- Retrieving data from the API and having a way to handle errors
- Shuffling the answers to avoid the user memorizing the correct answer position
- Displaying everything dynamically
- Having a score
- Implementing a replay system

## Future Goals

- Adding a loading screen while the data is being retrieved
- Showing the correct answer if the user fails
